## <a id='bigquery'></a>2 Bigqery Performance Optimization
- Reduce the amount of data to be processed by removing columns you donâ€™t need from your queries.
- Prevent unnecessary data scanning by using WHERE conditions intelligently.
- Partitioning data sets by timestamp or a specific column value to scan only the relevant data sections.
- In JOIN operations, it is usually more efficient to put the smaller table on the left side.
- If possible, filter tables before performing a JOIN operation.
- Minimise the use of ORDER BY on large data sets.
- Avoid unnecessary column usage in GROUP BY operations.
- If possible, pre-summarise the data in another table and perform queries on this summarised data.Avoid unnecessary column usage in GROUP BY operations.
- Prevent unnecessary cost increases by monitoring your slot usage.
- Optimise performance and keep costs under control by adjusting the number of slots according to your workload.
- Examine query plans with EXPLAIN to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimisation.
- Break very large queries into smaller, manageable chunks.
- UDFs can degrade performance; use built-in functions when possible.
- Improve query performance by using reusable and optimised stored procedures.UDFs can degrade performance; use built-in functions when possible.
- Monitor query performance regularly and make improvements when necessary.
- As your data sets change or grow, adapt your queries to these changes.
